      <h1>What Does the Modern American House Look Like?</h1>
      <h3>Well, it depends when and where it was built</h3>

      <p>Colonial or ranch? White picket fence or stone garden wall? Any number of characteristics might come to mind when imagining the quintessential American house, but data from the Census Bureau's <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/chars/">2019 Survey of Construction</a> unveils what really defines homes in the United States. Using data on newly constructed, single-family houses built from the 1970s to present, this survey illustrates how American homes differ depending on the time and place they were built. Here are some of the most interesting patterns that emerged.</p>

      <h2>Size</h2>
      <p>American houses have grown larger in the past 50 years—a lot larger. In 1973, the median, newly constructed home was 1,525 square feet. By 2019, new homes were a median 2,301 square feet in size. This increase was consistent across regions of the U.S.</p>

      <h2>Bed and Bath</h2>
      <p>From the 1970s to the end of the 2000s, a majority of newly-constructed homes had three bedrooms. But throughout that time, an increasing number of homes were built with four or more bedrooms, eventually surpassing three-bedroom homes in the late 2010s.</p>

      <div id="bed-chart"></div>
      <p id="middle-paragraph">A similar trend emerged in bathrooms, though the shift took place earlier. As soon as the early 1990s, homes with two and a half or more bathrooms outnumbered those with two bathrooms. Notably, the percentage of homes with one and a half or fewer bathrooms has steadily declined in the past 50 years.</p>

      <h2>Floors</h2>
      <p>Two-story homes are most common everywhere except the Midwest, where single-story homes have been more popular during the past decade. The Northeast notably contains less than half the single-story homes and more than twice the three-story homes of any other region.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 donut" id="west-floors-chart"></div>
      </div>

      <h2>Outdoor Features</h2>
      <p>Most single-family houses have outdoor living spaces—but different regions prefer different styles. Porches are popular everywhere, but patios are more often found in the South and West, while decks are most common in the Northeast.</p>

      <div id="outdoors-chart"></div>

      <h2>Building Materials</h2>
      <p>Materials used on houses' exteriors vary widely by region. While vinyl siding has dominated the Northeast and Midwest during the past decade, stucco remains the most popular material in the West. The South has the most even distribution of building materials, but uses brick over three times as often as any other region.</p>

      <div class="container-fluid row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 donut" id="northeast-materials-chart"></div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 donut" id="midwest-materials-chart"></div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 donut" id="west-materials-chart"></div>
      </div>

      <h2>Price</h2>
      <p>The median sale price of new homes has increased steadily since the late 1970s, with notable dips during recessions in the early 1990s and late 2000s. In 2019 dollars, the median American home sold for $218,406 in 1978, versus a median sale price of $321,500 in 2019. This trend is consistent across regions of the U.S., but beginning in the late 1980s, the value of homes in the Northeast and West has grown at a faster rate than the value of homes in the Midwest and South.</p>
